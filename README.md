# Introduction

Travel Bug is a mobile app designed for a client who's business is dedicated to creating study abroad opporunities for students around the globe. The app's purpose is to organize important details of a study abroad program. The primary features include providing itinerary events, a calendar to reference events, a GPS enabled map with pregenerated pins for locations tied to the study abroad program, an important contacts page, and a two-way messaging system.

There is separation between admin and student access levels in the app with authentication handled through Firebase. Admins are able to create urgent messages for students and other admins to see as well as create new events in the itinerary. Students are able to utilize the messaging system, but cannot flag urgent messages. All users are able to add custom notes to the important contacts page.

# Workflow and Key Lessons

Workflow was managed through GitHub and utilizing Agile workflow through Trello ticketing system. The team also had daily standup meetings to ensure everyone was on the same page on what was getting worked on and what still needed to be done.
